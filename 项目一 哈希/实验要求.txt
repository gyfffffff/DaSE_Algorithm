Project 1: Similarity Search
Task Description: Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular approaches to similarity search on high-dimensional data. The following dataset is an undirected graph representing the co-authorship between researchers. You need to construct an LSH scheme for similarity search: For any query node, you should find the top-10 nodes (excluding itself) whose neighbor sets have the highest Jaccard similarity scores with that of the query node. In the final report, please illustrate the performance of similarity search, such as accuracy, index time, query time, and space usage, etc.
